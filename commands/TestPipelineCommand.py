# Concrete Command for initiating test pipeline steps.
class TestPipelineCommand( ITestCommand ):
    """
    The selected code defines a class named TestPipelineCommand which is a specific type of command that can be executed in a testing pipeline. This class is a blueprint for creating objects that can carry out a particular set of actions related to testing software.
    
    The purpose of the code is to provide a way to encapsulate a testing strategy within a command object. This allows for the execution of the testing strategy to be controlled and managed by other parts of the system, such as an orchestrator.

    The input it takes is an object that adheres to the ITestStrategy interface. This means that the input must be an object that has an execute_strategy method. This strategy object represents the specific actions that need to be taken when the command is executed.

    The output it produces is not directly returned as a value but is the result of the strategy being executed. When the command's execute method is called, it triggers the strategy's execute_strategy method, which will carry out the testing actions defined in the strategy.

    It achieves its purpose through a simple delegation pattern. The TestPipelineCommand has a method named execute, and when this method is called, it simply calls the execute_strategy method on the strategy object it holds. This means that the command acts as a middleman, passing the request to execute onto the strategy object.

    There is an important logic flow happening when the execute method is called on a TestPipelineCommand object. When this method is called, the command object doesn't perform the testing actions itself. Instead, it tells the strategy object to perform these actions by calling the strategy's execute_strategy method. This separation of concerns allows for different testing strategies to be used interchangeably without changing the command object itself.

    In summary, the TestPipelineCommand class is a container for a testing strategy. It takes a strategy object as input and when told to execute, it triggers the strategy to perform its defined actions. This design allows for flexible and controlled execution of testing processes within a software application.
