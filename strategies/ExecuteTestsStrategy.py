    The selected code introduces a class named ExecuteTestsStrategy. This class is like a specific instruction booklet that tells a computer program how to run tests on software. Running tests is like a series of checks to make sure everything in the software works as it should.

    Purpose of the code: The purpose of this ExecuteTestsStrategy class is to outline a specific way to run tests on software. It's like a placeholder now, saying "Here's where you'll put the steps to run tests," but it doesn't have the actual steps yet.

    Inputs: This class doesn't show any inputs being taken directly. Normally, you'd expect it to work with the software that needs testing, but the details of how it gets that software aren't provided here.

    Outputs: Similarly, the class doesn't show any outputs. Outputs would be the results of the tests, like "passed" or "failed," but this code doesn't say how those results are displayed or recorded.

    How it achieves its purpose: The ExecuteTestsStrategy class has a function called execute_strategy. This is where the steps to run the tests would go. Right now, it's empty, with just a pass statement, which is a way of saying "nothing happens here yet." When someone fills in this part with real instructions, that's when the class will actually be able to run tests.

    Logic flows and data transformations: Since the actual test-running logic isn't included, there are no data transformations or logic flows happening in this code. When the test-running instructions are added, this is where the software being tested would be checked, and the results would be created and handled.

    In simple terms, think of the ExecuteTestsStrategy as an empty checklist with the title "Steps to Run Tests on Software." The checklist doesn't have any steps written down yet, but once it does, it will guide the computer through the process of testing software to make sure it works correctly. This class is designed to fit into a larger system where it can be swapped out with other "instruction booklets" for different tasks, like compiling code or reporting test results.
